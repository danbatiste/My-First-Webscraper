# My-First-Webscraper

I remember making this in September of 2016. It was right around when I was applying for colleges. I needed to grab a list of colleges off of a site with the top 200 in the US and print it out. The site was pretty poorly designed though, and it only showed 10 per page, along with a ton of ads and images and other stuff that I didn't want to print 20 pages of.

This program grabbed the content of each heading element on the page and put it in a list. Then it joined each element in the list by a newline character to make one long string that I pasted into a word document and printed. The final list was one page long, small font.

This is the first real program I ever created in Python (my first real programming language). When I started, I knew nothing about webscrapers, but by the end I had learned a lot about webscrapers and about Python.
